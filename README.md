# Java Recipe file writer

* This program prompts the user to input a recipe name
* The number of ingredients for that recipe. They then are prompted to add all the ingredients.
* Then the steps to make that recipe
* The program will then write these to a file that they can convert and print for their own use in their homes. Or they can keep it electronically and store it however they want. 

### Good little starter project for learning java
* This project was a good kickstart to learning some of the basics of Java! 
* Really helped my learning in how Java intreacts with files and the various commands inside the language.
