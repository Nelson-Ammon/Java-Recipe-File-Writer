# Overview
This is a small java project I created to learn the basics of java! The main purpose of this software was to be more familiar with how java worked as a programming language and feel more comfortable with the basics of how it can be used.

This software asks for input from the user and prints it all out to a markdown file where the user can export it to a PDF. Or the user can store it on the computer in anyway that they would like!

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code and the OpenJDK from oracle to write in java. This was super simple to set up! I use windows and it was pretty stress free! 


# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that i found really helpful while going on this journy to build this software. Hopefully they can help you too.
* [W3 Schools Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
* [Java T Point](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial)
* [Java from ORACLE](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html)



# Future Work

Here are some things that I plan on adding in the future to make the software a little more robust and easier to use!
* Function that auto creates a PDF after the user is done with entering recipes.
* Ability to add photos of the foods to recipes.
* Ability to edit recipes after they have been entered into the software
